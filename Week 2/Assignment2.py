# During the pandemic era of 2020, Chennai faced a severe outbreak of COVID-19. A citywide lockdown was imposed, restricting people from leaving their homes. To ensure citizens had access to essential supplies like food and medicine, the State Government of Chennai devised a plan to use drones for contactless delivery, maintaining strict social distancing protocols.

# Each drone has a fixed carrying capacity, represented as an integer in the array capacities , and all drones are identical in functionality apart from their carrying capacity. To optimize the delivery process and minimize resource wastage, the government aims to select exactly x
#  drones such that each of these x
#  drones has a carrying capacity of at leastx
#  . This selection process ensures the fleet's efficiency aligns with the demand for heavier deliveries.

# Your task is to determine the "critical capacity" x
#  , such that exactly x
#  drones can meet this x
# criterion. If no such x
#  exists, return âˆ’1
#  . It is guaranteed that if a "critical capacity" exists, it will be unique

# Input Format

# The first line of the input contains a single integer t, representing the number of test cases.
# For each test case, the input consists of two lines:
# The first line contains a single integer n
# , the length of the array.
# The second line contains $n$ space-separated positive integers, representing the array capacities.
